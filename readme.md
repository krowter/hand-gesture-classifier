# Hand Gesture Classifier

This is an _iseng_ project to build classifier for American Sign Language alphabet.

I trained the model using Google Teachable Machine then loaded and predicted the gesture using Tensorflow.

After you cloned this repo and installed the packages, you can start it using `node server.js` and hit the "Enable Webcam" button.

You can google "ASL Alphabet" for the handsigns.

_Note: results are better if you have a plain background behind your hand_
